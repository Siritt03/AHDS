# Assessment AHDS

The aim of this mini project is toexplore trends in COVID-19 publications. 
To achieve this, I will download, process and visualize data onthe text of research articles.

Unit Leads: Oliver Davis and Louise Millard.


## Environment

All tasks should be designed to run on BlueCrystal as part of a SnakeMake pipeline.

Install required Python and R packages: 
The environment is recorded in the AHDS_environment.yml file in this directory. 
To create this environment in Conda, use

conda env create --file AHDS_environment.yml
conda activate AHDS_env

activation environment
conda activate AHDS_env


## Running the Program

### Step1: Download
Retrieve the IDs of the relevant articles from this URL:

```bash
https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/esearch.fcgi?db=pubmed&term=%22long%20c ovid%22&retmax=10000
```

Then retrieve the article meta data for each article using a URL such as:
```bash
https://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/efetch.fcgi?db=pubmed&id=39240571
```
Take a pause between downloadingeach article fileso that the PubMed website isnâ€™t overwhelmed with requests.
```bash
sleep 1 
```

### Step2: Process

Extract the year and titleof each article and store these in a tab separated file with three columns: PMID, year, and title.

Remove any xml tags(e.g.<i>and </i>)from the titles.
Remove any rows forarticles that do not have a title

### Step3: Tidytext

Process the titles using the tidytext package. 
Removing stop words and digits and reduce words to their stem


### Step4: visualisation

This part count the frequency of occurrence of high-frequency words in different years based on the cleaned headline data and generate a trend graph over time.
